	<h2>What is grammar?</h2>
			<p>
			Grammar is the rules of how words and sentences are used. With these rules we can communicate and understand each other. When someone says: "Look at that cat!", you will know that they have spottet an animal with pointy ears, fluffy fur and a long tail. Because your have learnt that cat is the name of one of ours most known animals here in Norway. The word "cat" is a noun, and nouns are names of things. The word "look" is a verb, and describes action words. So either someone else is performing an action, or you are. Because you have some skills in English vocabulary and grammar, you are able to decode the sentence and understand exactly what the person saying it means to say.
